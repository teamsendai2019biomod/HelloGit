             <h2>Supplementary Information</h2>
        <h3>Condition Comparisons<hr></h3>
             <p>In order to progress HCR more, we changed the experimental condition. At this point, we
changed the incubation time, thermo condition. The results are shown in the figure below.
             </p>
            
        <h4>Incubation time</h4>
             <p>
We wanted to confirm the effect of incubation time on HCR. Therefore, we performed the
experiment with two varieties of incubation time, one-hour incubation and overnight incubation. We
expected that the longer the incubation process is, the more we can find the bands near the well. 
             </p>

                 <p>Fig.S1 Examination of effect of incubation time(1hr at room temperature)
                 </p>
             </div>
             
             <p><br>
                 Compared to the one incubated overnight(Fig.1), there was no such big difference between
these two samples. From this result, we concluded that 1 hour incubation is enough for hybridization of
our DNA components. Thus, we decided to incubate the prepared samples for 1 hour before
electrophoresis.
                  <br><br><br>
             </p>
    <h4>Temperature condition</h4>
             <p>In general, at higher temperature, hybridization reaction will be accelerated. Thus, we tried to
confirm the effect of temperature. (Fig.3)<br><br>
Compared to Fig.S1, we observed more bands near the well. Lane 13(C+H1+H2) and
15(A’+R’+H1+H2) especially showed Smeared band, which matches S. Venkataraman (2007). However,
smeared bands are barely seen(Fig.2), suggesting that bands that formed near the well are unstable
structures, which will transform into more stable structures.
</p>
<h4>Hairpin DNAs concentration (Fig.4)</h4>
             <p>
We thought the result (Fig.4A) was due to the lack of hairpin DNA compared to S.
Venkataraman (2007) . So, we conducted the experiment to confirm the effect of higher hairpin DNAs
concentration. As a result, there is no big change between the one with higher hairpin DNA
concentration and the one with lower hairpin DNA concentration (Fig.4B, lane 14 &amp; 17) . Thus, for
hairpin DNA, 4 times as much concentration as the initiator is still enough for hybridization reaction.

                 <h4>First examination of HCR</h4>

                 </p>
                 A is with acrydite modification this time, while A used for electrophoresis in the main page are without acrydite
modification. Concentration ratio is the same as other electrophoresis. Hairpin DNA was introduced in 2 hours
after mixing other DNA.
                </div>
             <p>As a result, we can observe clear smeared band, suggesting that our components may have
more potency than suggested in the main page. However, as it is written above, the condition of L is
different from other electrophoresis results, although the sequence itself is the same. We have to
consider why we cannot reproduce the same result as Fig.5 after Japanese competition.</p>

                </div>
             <p>As shown in Fig.1, the smeared bands were observed when the hairpin DNAs were introduced to
the initiator (Fig.S3, lane 16 &amp; 18 ). We thought bent lanes at the bottom was caused by bubble or
having put high voltage during a short time.</p>
             
             <h4>Confirmation of reaction limitation by R’</h4> 
             <p>Furthermore, we tried to confirm R’ effect on delaying the HCR by restricting the toehold length of
R’.(Fig.4B) As a result, the one without R’ doesn’t differ from the one mixed altogether, suggesting that
R’ doesn’t limit the hybridization in our DNA samples.<br><br><br></p>
