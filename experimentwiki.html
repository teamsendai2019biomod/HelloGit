             <h2>Main</h2>
             <h3>Objective of our experiments</h3>
             <p>Here, we propose a system to realize gel extending and shrinking, developed on an approach
                based on DNA hybridization chain reaction(HCR).
                Our system is what we call Reversible hybridization chain reaction(RHCR), in which DNA strand
                extending and shrinking occur reversibly.
                In this experiment, we have planned to confirm if DNA strands would extend and shrink by adding DNA
                hairpins performing RHCR.</p>
             <p>
            <h3>Purpose &amp; Method</h3>
             <p>
                 Before we proceed to the RHCR experiment, we tried to examine the progression of HCR by
                electrophoresis using DNA sequences based on A.Cangialosi(2017). RHCR consists of HCR for DNA
                extending. Therefore, performing experiments on HCR makes it possible to investigate both
                experimental condition and validity of RHCR.
                For this experiment, we performed Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(PAGE) (See Material &amp; Method
                for further information about electrophoresis)to confirm HCR. In order to show experimentally which
                sequence drives HCR, we prepared the 31 samples based on the existence/absence of 5 DNA
                components. And in order to simplify the experimental condition, We referred to S. Venkataraman
                (2007) and fixated the concentration ratio of all five samples.(C:C’:H1:H2:A=1:1:4:4:2)
                The results are shown in the figure below.

                 Because we have 20 lanes at most in PAGE ,we divided the experiments into two sections. (See
                Supplementary information for further information about our experimental result.)
                First, about 4 samples except A, we conducted the experiment to confirm HCR.(Fig.1)
                
                For H1 and H2, the bands observed above 20 bp were structures in the form of hairpins. (Fig.1) There
                were some bands from around 120 bp to 160bp when Initiator was added to the solution with H1 and
                H2(Lane 13,15), enough for constructing tetramer, suggesting that HCR had occurred. (Fig.1.A)
                Second, about 4 samples all with A, we conducted the experiment to confirm HCR.(Fig.2) Smeared
                bands, bands caused by different size of structures formed by HCR, were observed (Lane 16,18).
                The results above matched with S. Venkataraman (2007), which means there is a high possibility for us
                to replicate conventional HCR.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                We concluded that HCR progression was observed well upon the inducement of initiator. And
            we conducted some other experiments to find out the better experimental condition to confirm HCR.
            (See Supplementary information for other electrophoresis results.) Thus, at this rate, there is a high
            possibility that we could observe the more smeared bands near the well, which matches more with S.
            Venkataraman (2007).
