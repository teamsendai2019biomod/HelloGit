             <p><br><br><br>“ELSI”  is   an   abbreviation   for   “ethical,   legal   and   social   implications”.Science and technology are key drivers of development. Technological andscientific revolutions underpin economical advances, as well as improvementsin health systems, education, and infrastructure. However, in some cases, theymay have an unexpected impact on society. The area of ELSI research is toforesee such effects and consider how to deal with them.<br><br></p>
             <p>The term ELSI appeared in the 
                 <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">“Human Genome Project”</a> 
                 that started in theUnited States in 1990. The Human Genome Project is a research project thatattempts to decipher all human genetic information (human genome). Theimpact that human genome research can have is not limited to doctors andpatients, but it affects everyone, extending to society as a whole. For thisreason,   ELSI   research   needs   to   be   conducted   from   various   perspectives,including the general public, policymakers, and companies. ELSI research thushas an interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary character, and therefore can beapplied not only to human genome research, but also to today's various cutting-edge research and technologies.<br><br></p>
             <p>In modern society, technology is overflowing, and new technology is bornalmost   every   minute.   In   addition   to   the   fact   that   division   of   labor   andspecialization has proceeded, it is almost impossible for the ordinary citizen tograsp and fully understand every technology used in their daily lives. However,trust from society is indispensable in order for new research to progress andtechnology to advance and become implemented in daily life. This is why it isimportant for researchers whom have expertized knowledge and are most likelyto be the founding fathers of such new technologies, to consider ELSI. Theymust contribute to the safety and welfare of the citizens, taking the initiative ingaining their trust. Therefore, here we will discuss and describe our project fromall ethical, legal and social viewpoints, and deepen the understanding of ourproject from a different angle.<br><br></p>
             <h5>Ethical Issues</h5>
             <p>The ethical issues in this project are mainly those involving DNA handling andvector  handling during  artificial   DNA  synthesis. In  general, in  experiments
involving DNA, in fields such as genetic recombination, the safety associatedtherewith is a problem. However, in this study there is no need for this to beconsidered, since DNA is used as a material rather than genetic information.Strict management is required for the handling of ordered DNA, and it is anobligation to inactivate it at the time of disposal; we confirm these rules wereabided in this study.<br>
             In   addition,   the   DNA   we   handled   in   our   experimented   were   ordered   andsynthesized by an outside company (Eurofins Genomics) where phage DNA wasused for building the scaffolds or DNA origami. Phage is a microscopic structurethat may self-replicate using the cells of other organisms. The following is true:“phage has its own genes, and can grow by using the cells of other organisms”;however, since it does not have an actual cell of its own, which is the smallestunit of an organism, phage is not defined as a living organism, according to thedefinition of life. This is why normal provisions regarding experiments involvingliving organisms cannot be directly applied.<br>
                 For instance, although the current animal experiment provisions in Japan has<a href="http://www.clar.med.tohoku.ac.jp/data/kitei/10th/hoi1-10th-E-monkashou.pdf">“Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and RelatedActivities inAcademic Research Institutions”</a>(2006), which is based on the <a href="https://olaw.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Guiding_Principles_2012.pdf">“InternationalGuiding   Principles   for   Biomedical   Research” </a> published   by   the   Council   forInternational Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) (1985, revised 2012),regulations concerning phage are not dealt with.<br>
                 Regardless, as mentioned in our<a href="futurewiki.html"> FUTURE</a> section, this research is aimed at thedevelopment of biomaterials with biocompatibility in the future. Thus along thecourse   of   development   towards   application,   ethical   guidelines   concerninghuman and animal application such as the following:  <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjrt/73/5/73_2017_JSRT_73.5.397/_article/-char/en">“Ethical Guidelines forMedical  and  Health   Research   Involving   Human   Subjects” </a> (2014)  and<a href="http://www.scj.go.jp/ja/info/kohyo/pdf/kohyo-20-k16-2e.pdf">“Basic Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Testing and Related Activities in theResearch Institutions under the Jurisdiction of the MHLW”</a> (2006, revised 2015),must be considered seriously.<br><br></p>
             <h5>Legal Issues</h5>
             <p>Upon the development of synthetic biology, genetic engineering in particular,various international outlines have been defined, including the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/convention/">“Convention onBiological Diversity”</a> (1992, Rio Earth Summit),<a href="https://www.env.go.jp/en/laws/nature/act_csubdrlmo.pdf"> “Act on the conservation andsustainable   use   of   biological   diversity   through   regulation   on   the   use   of
                 genetically modified organisms”</a> (2003) (commonly known as “Cartagena Act”),etc. Consequently, legislation in Japan is progressing, and the handling of DNAas genetic information is strictly regulated. However, the handling of DNA andRNA molecules as materials used in molecular robotics is not defined in Japannor in other countries, and the management is entrusted to the person incharge of the experiment.<br>
                 However, many of the designs proposed in molecular robotics are to be appliedto human bodies. It is necessary to develop laws based on the possibility thatthese designed will be implemented in society. Since there are almost noproceeding examples of technology using biomolecules applied to the humanbody,   when   considering   clinical   trials   of   implementing   drug   delivery   forexample, it is necessary to carefully carry out clinical trials based on ethicalguidelines on clinical practice in addition to complying with the <a href="https://www.pmda.go.jp/files/000152996.pdf">“MinisterialOrdinance on Good Clinical Practice for Drugs”</a> (or GCP, short for Good ClinicalPractice)(2012).<br><br></p>
             <h5>Social Issues</h5>
             <p>Molecular robotics is one of the prominent fields where future development isexpected from the possibility of social implementation of the research. However, as of now it is still much under-recognized, and perhaps it could besaid that most people are completely unfamiliar with the field. In truth, evensynthetic biology, which lies as the basic foundation of molecular robotics stillhas a relatively low recognition rate; this can be told from the survey performedin 2010 in Japan, involving over 1500 university students and general citizens,where only approximately 15% of the respondents replied to have heard of theword   "synthetic   biology".   Thus   it   can   be   predicted   that   it   will   still   takeconsiderable time for the designs proposed in molecular robotics to be actuallyapplied in real life.<br>
                 Moreover, although DNA is only used as a material in molecular robotics, ingeneral, DNA has a strong image as “genetic information” and the field ofmolecular robotics is mistakenly recognized due to concerns about technologysuch as genetic engineering. Perhaps due to compulsory education in Japanmainly   teaching   DNA   only   dealt   as   genetic   information,   DNA   is   generallyrecognized as equivalent to gene. Furthermore, according to the  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642419/">consumerintention   survey   regarding   GMOs   by   the   Consumer   Affairs   Agency</a>,   the
percentage of respondents who answered to have anxiety about geneticallymodified foods reached 47.7%, while even out of those responding to nothaving anxieties, more than 80% answered to evade genetically modified foods.In light of this, it seems that the social perception of DNA needs to change inorder   for   molecular   robotics   technology   such   as   this   research   that   usesartificially synthesized DNA as a material to be implemented in society. Inaddition, a challenge in improving social awareness will be to ensure that theinvented design and technology are safe.<br><br></p>
