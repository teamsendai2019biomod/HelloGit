The controllable expansion and shrinking of polyacrymide gel make the coverage area of the gel can change to response from stimuli. The application of controllable size of hydrogel can be utilized as framework of tiny robot. Tiny robots at the micro- and nanoscale have recently attracted great attention because of their unprecedented features and functions as well as enormous potential applications, especially in the areas of health care and biomedicine (1). 
                 <br><br>
                 Tiny robots, as like normal robot, needs to be controllable and programable through given signal. There are various signals that’s usually usedfor tiny robots, such as DNA strands, heat, light, and electric potential. For example, Murata et al. (2017) has published a paper about liposome that changes shape in response to DNA strands. However, the movement of liposome is not directional and reversible. In our case, the gel movement is still not viable, but the expansion and shrinking size of gel is now reversible. Thus, the gel can be developed as a drug carrier in the future. An indispensable property of hydrogel for drug carrier is the biocompatibility of hydrogels, which could be defined as the ability of a material to be in contact with the body organs without any damages for the surrounding tissues and without triggeringany undesirable response.
                 <br><br>
                 Our gel function is not limited just for drug carrier and tiny robots. Hydrogel has unique properties of such as high-water content, softness, flexibility and biocompatibility (2). These characteristics resembles living tissueopens up application for tissue engineering and wound dressings. Tissue engineering is a more recent application of hydrogels, in which they can be applied as space filling agents, as delivery vehicles for bioactive substances or as three-dimensional structures that organize cells and present stimuli to ensure the development of a required tissue (2). The bioactive substances are substituted to the gel, and then the gel is injected to broken-part tissue in body.As the tissue is being repaired, the growth of tissue could be happened. By using the controllable expansion characteristic of gel, the gel can follow the growth of tissue which maximize efficiency of transferring bioactive substancesto the tissue.
                 <br><br>
                 In material perspectives, doping can be added to the hydrogel to changeits conductivity property. Due to the mechanical similarity to biointerfaces such as human skin, conductive hydrogels have been primarily utilized as bioelectrodes, specifically neuroprosthetic electrodes, in an attempt to replace metallic electrodes by enhancing the mechanical properties and long-term stability of the electrodes within living organisms (3). The swelling and shrinking capabilities of the gel can be used to insert the gel to narrow and 
unreachable place inside the body. We can control the coverage by shrinking/swelling the gel from outside of body.
                 <br><br>
                 The gel is not the only thing that can be utilized from this project. Hybridization ChainReaction (HCR) and reverse hybridization chain reaction (RHCR), used for shrinking and swelling gel, are imitating actin polymerization and depolymerization dynamics. The actin in cell has a multitude of functions, such as intracellular transport, adhesion and contraction, membrane dynamics and migration, cytokinesis and cell–cell contact regulation, polarity and cell shape control (4). By mimicking the process, this project could lead to programmable functions of actin in the future.
