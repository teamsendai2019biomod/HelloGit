             <h5>Preparation of Buffer</h5>
             <p>Buffer was made from 50×TAE and 125mM (CH3COO)2Mg that mixed to make final concentration 1×TAE with 12.5 mM Mg2+. This buffer was given the name as 1×buffer.</p>
             <h5>Annealing</h5>
                <p>In preparation of DNA hairpins used for HCR, each of H1 and H2 were dissolved in 1× buffer. Then, both solutions of H1 and H2 was kept at 95 °C for five minutes and afterward cooled down by 1 °C per minute until the temperature reached 4°C by using Mastercycle machine.<br><br>
                For reference, we prepared another solution of H1, H2, C, and C’ that mixed together in 1× buffer.  The mixed solution was kept at 95 °C for five minutes and afterward cooled down by 1 °C per minute until the temperature reached 25 °C by using Mastercycle machine. </p>

             <h4>Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis</h4>
             <h5>Sample preparation</h5>
             <p>DNA Master Stock was diluted to make sub-master stocks DNA because DNA Master Stock is too concentrated for making gel electrophoresis sample. Every time we prepared new sub-master stocks, the concentration was checked again with absorbance to ensure the target concentration.  After that, we prepared samples from all probability combination of C, C', H1 and H2 for gel electrophoresis. The more detail information about the recipe for the sample and sub-master stock can be downloaded from supplementary files below.</p>

             <h5>Preparation of polyacrylamide gel and technique for electrophoresis</h5>
             <p>The preparation of 10% polyacrylamide gel and technique to do gel electrophoresis are following the standard procedures below.</p>
             
          
             
                 <p>1. 8 mL 5×TBE buffer, 3 mL 30%-Acrylamide/Bis Mixed Solution, 90 µL 10% Ammonium Persulfate (APS), 9 µL TEMED were mixed to make 9 mL/10% polyacrylamide gel.
                 <br>2.	The mixture was solidified for approx. 30 mins, at 25 ℃.
                 <br>3.	The solidified gel was set on the electrophoresis chamber.
                 <br>4.	1×TBE buffer running buffer was poured into the electrophoresis chamber.
                 <br>5.	1×ladder solution (20 bps), strand samples were prepared by mixing 1 µL 20× ladder, 19 µL 1×TAE/12,5 mM Mg2+ Buffer, and 4 µL 6×Loading buffer.
                 <br>6.	6 µL of each mixture was applied to each well. 
                 <br>7.	100 V voltage was applied for an hour in room temperature.
                 <br>8.	The gel was stained by SYBR GOLD for 20 minutes.
                 <br>9.	Fluorescence was observed by gel imager (ChemiDoc MP, BIO-RAD, USA).
             </p>
             
             
             <h4>Analyzing the data</h4>
             <h5>Gel Electrophoresis</h5>
             <p>
                 1. The image was analyzed using software Fiji.
                 <br>2. The gel photograph colour was inverted.
                 <br>3. The image contrast was adjusted to easily analyze the band.
                 <br>4. To analyze each lane, the lane was selected using the rectangle function
                 <br>5. The fluorescence data from each lane was obtained using plot line function.
                 <br>6. The data of each analyzed lane was integrated, and the fluorescence intensity value for each distance was plotted with Excel to create a graph.</p>
